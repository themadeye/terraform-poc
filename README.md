<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Toward the end of 2024, I took a look back at my time and realized I hadn’t learned any new technology for quite some time. Eventually, I chose Terraform as my learning initiative to end the year, and it leads to this blog where I want to share my learning journey to all the readers.

Terraform is an IAC tool that is specifically useful as an infrastructure provisioning tool. Terraform is capable of deploying infrastructure across multiple platforms and managing infrastructure on different kinds of platforms through the so-called ‘providers’. Every platform has its corresponding providers to maintain, and allow developers to interact with their cloud services or APIs through Terraform.

What we're about to dive here is a simple POC of usages in Terraform, let's get started!
